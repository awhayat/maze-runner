# Maze Runner

This app presents a maze occupied by a controllable on-screen character. As you move through the maze, every action you take is recorded, and a password can be generated at any time based on their order. For example:

- moving left
- moving right
- moving up
- moving down
- breaking a wall
- a "fail": attempting to move into a wall or out of the maze, or to break a wall that doesn't exist

The only thing you need to remember is which maze to use, and what kind of path to take through it; the same password is regenerated every time.

Today we handle a huge variety of online accounts. Some are minor or of little importance, but others require strong, unique passwords that are updated regularly, such as online banking, education, and social media. One way to keep effective passwords is to store them in a password manager program. However, by doing so you are putting all your eggs in one basket provided by a third party company, and you still need to keep your master password secure. Password managers can and have been hacked.

With the Maze Runner, your passwords aren't stored anywhere at all; they are generated upon request. Even if someone gains access to your app files, they will not be able to extract any password unless they know exactly which maze to use, and what kind of path to take through it.

#### Set up:
- download latest release
- open Maze Runner.jar
- **do not modify the data folder** e.g. when updating
- it is recommended to include the data folder in your regular back-up routine, as this saves the mazes you use to generate passwords
- requires java installed on your computer; latest version can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
